# Stream-oriented GE Open API

The Stream Oriented Generic Enabler (GE) provides a framework devoted to simplify the development of complex interactive multimedia applications through a rich family of APIs and toolboxes. It provides a media server and a set of client APIs making simple the development of advanced video applications for WWW and smartphone platforms. The Stream Oriented GE features include group communications, transcoding, recording, mixing, broadcasting and routing of audiovisual flows. It also provides advanced media processing capabilities involving computer vision, video indexing, augmented reality and speech analysis.

The Stream Oriented GEâ€™s core element is a Media Server, responsible for media transmission, processing, loading and recording. This Media Server exposes a full fledged Open API to let application clients to process media in several ways. These clients require requires full-duplex communications between the server infrastructure. For this reason, the Stream Oriented GE Open API is resource-oriented and it is accessed via WebSockets that uses JSON-RPC V2.0 for information exchange.

## Status

Final version aligned with FIWARE Release 4.

## Group JSON-RPC Messages format

An JSON-RPC call is represented by sending a request message to a server. The request messages has the following members:

* `jsonrpc`: a string specifying the version of the JSON-RPC protocol. It must be exactly `2.0`.
* `id`: an unique identifier established by the client that contains a string or number. The server must reply with the same value in the response message. This member is used to correlate the context between both messages.
* `method`: a string containing the name of the method to be invoked.
* `params`: a structured value that holds the parameter values to be used during the invocation of the method.

Therefore, the value of the `method` parameter in the request determines the type of request/response to be exchanged between client and server. The following section describes each pair of messages depending of the type of `method` (namely: `Ping`, `Create`, `Invoke`, `Release`, `Subscribe`, `Unsubscribe`, and `OnEvent`).

When an RPC call is made by a client, the server replies with a response object. In the case of a success, the response object contains the following members:

* `jsonrpc`: it must be exactly `2.0`.
* `id`: it must match the value of the id member in the request object.
* `result`: structured value which contains the invocation result.

In the case of an error, the response object contains the following members:

* `jsonrpc`: it must be exactly `2.0`.
* `id`: it must match the value of the id member in the request object.
* `error`: object describing the error through the following members:
    * `code`: integer number that indicates the error type that occurred
    * `message`: string providing a short description of the error.
    * `data`: primitive or structured value that contains additional information about the error. It may be omitted. The value of this member is defined by the server.

## Group WebSocket Connection

To establish a WebSocket connection, the client sends a WebSocket handshake request, for which the media server returns a WebSocket handshake response.

## WebSocket Handshake [/kurento]

### Handshake [GET]

+ Request

    + Headers
    
            Upgrade: websocket
            Connection: Upgrade
            Sec-WebSocket-Key: daecIhfhHeDfYP4rJivWjQ==
            Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13

+ Response 101

## Group Ping

In order to warranty the WebSocket connectivity between the client and the Kurento Media Server, a keep-alive method is implemented. This method is based on a `ping` method sent by the client, which must be replied with a `pong` message from the server. If no response is obtained in a time interval, the client is aware that the connectivity with the media server has been lost.

### Request

A `ping` request contains the following parameters:

* `method` (required, string). Value: `ping`.
* `params` (required, object). Parameters for the invocation of the ping message, containing these member:
    * interval (required, number). Time out to receive the `pong` message from the server, in milliseconds. By default this value is `240000` (i.e. 40 seconds).

This is an example of `ping`:

+ Body (application/json)

        {
            "id": 1,
            "method": "ping",
            "params": {
                "interval": 240000
            },
            "jsonrpc": "2.0"
        }

### Response

The response to a `ping` request must contain a `result` object with a `value` parameter with a fixed name: `pong`. The following snippet shows the `pong` response to the previous `ping` request:

+ Body (application/json)

        {
            "id": 1,
            "result": {
                "value": "pong"
            },
            "jsonrpc": "2.0"
        }

## Group Create

Create message requests the creation of an Media Pipelines and Media Elements in the Media Server. The parameter type specifies the type of the object to be created. The parameter `params` contains all the information needed to create the object. Each message needs different parameters to create the object.

A `sessionId` parameter is included with the identifier of the current session. The value of this parameter is sent by Kurento Media Server to the client in each response. Only the first requests from client to server are allowed to not include the `sessionId` (because at this point is unknown for the client).

### Request

A `create` request contains the following parameters:

* `method` (required, string). Value: `create`.
* `params` (required, object). Parameters for the invocation of the create message, containing these members:
    * type (required, string). Media pipeline or media element to be created. The allowed values are the following:
        * `MediaPipeline`: Media Pipeline to be created.
        * `WebRtcEndpoint`: This Endpoint offers media streaming using WebRTC.
        * `RtpEndpoint`: Endpoint that provides bidirectional content delivery capabilities with remote networked peers through RTP protocol. It contains paired sink and source MediaPad for audio and video.
        * `HttpPostEndpoint`: This type of Endpoint provide unidirectional communications. Its MediaSource are related to HTTP POST method. It contains sink MediaPad for audio and video, which provide access to an HTTP file upload function.
        * `PlayerEndpoint`: It provides function to retrieve contents from seekable sources in reliable mode (does not discard media information) and inject them into KMS. It contains one MediaSource for each media type detected.
        * `RecorderEndpoint`: Provides function to store contents in reliable mode (doesn't discard data). It contains MediaSink pads for audio and video.
        * `FaceOverlayFilter`: It detects faces in a video feed. The face is then overlaid with an image.
        * `ZBarFilter`: This Filter detects QR and bar codes in a video feed. When a code is found, the filter raises a CodeFound.
        * `GStreamerFilter`: This is a generic Filter interface, that creates GStreamer filters in the media server.
        * `Composite`: A Hub that mixes the audio stream of its connected sources and constructs a grid with the video streams of its connected sources into its sink.
        * `Dispatcher`: A Hub that allows routing between arbitrary port pairs.
        * `DispatcherOneToMany`: A Hub that sends a given source to all the connected sinks.
    * `constructorParams` (required, object). Additional parameters. For example:
        * `mediaPipeline` (optional, string): This parameter is only mandatory for Media Elements. In that case, the value of this parameter is the identifier of the media pipeline which is going to contain the Media Element to be created.
        * `uri` (optional, string): This parameter is only required for Media Elements such as `PlayerEndpoint` or `RecorderEndpoint`. It is an URI used in the Media Element, i.e. the media to be played (for `PlayerEndpoint`) or the location of the recording (for `RecorderEndpoint`).
        *  `properties` (optional, object): Array of additional objects (key/value).
    * `sessionId` (optional, string). Session identifier. This parameter is not present in the first request (typically the media pipeline creation).

The following example shows a request message requesting the creation of an object of the type `MediaPipeline`:

+ Body (application/json)

        {
            "id": 2,

            "jsonrpc": "2.0"
        }

## Group OnEvent

When a client is `subscribed` to a type of events in an object, the server sends an onEvent request each time an event of that type is fired in the object. This is possible because the Stream Oriented open API is implemented with WebSockets and there is a full duplex channel between client and server.

An `OnEvent` request contains the following parameters:

* `method` (required, string). Value is `onEvent`.
* `params` (required, object). 
    * `value` (required, object)
        * `data` (required, object)
            * `source` (required, string). Source media element.
            * `tags` (optional, string array). Metadata for the media element.
            * `timestamp` (required, number). Media server time and date (in Unix time, i.e., number of seconds since 01/01/1970).
            * `type` (required, string).

        * `object` (required, object).Media element identifier.
        * `type` (required, string). Type identifier (same value than before)

The following example shows a notification sent for server to client to notify an event of type `EndOfStream` in a `PlayerEndpoint` object:

+ Body (application/json)

        {
