Welcome to Kurento - FIWARE STREAM ORIENTED GENERIC ENABLER
===========================================================

The *Stream Oriented GE Kurento* is a multimedia platform aimed to help
developers to add multimedia capabilities to their applications. The
core element is the *Kurento Media Server* (KMS), a
`Gstreamer <http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/>`__ based multimedia
engine that provides the following features:

-  Networked streaming protocols, including *HTTP*, *RTP* and *WebRTC*.
-  Media transcodification between any of the codecs currently supported
   by Gstreamer.
-  Generic support for computational vision and augmented reality
   filters.
-  Media storage supporting writing operations for *WebM* and *MP4* and
   reading operations for any of *Gstreamer’s* muxers.

With Kurento, it’s an easy task to add third-party media processing
algorithms to any WebRTC application, like integrating Computer Vision,
Augmented Reality, video indexing, and speech analysis. For example,
features such as speech recognition, sentiment analysis or face
recognition can be developed by specialized teams, and then seamlessly
added to Kurento as new modules.

Here we present the FIWARE focused User Manual and Admin Guide.
